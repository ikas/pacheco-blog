      <p>My name is Henrique Pacheco, 25 years old, and I was born and live in Braga, Portugal.</p>
      <p>I graduated from Universidade do Minho in Software Engineering <HighlightLabel>(feb 2018)</HighlightLabel>, and started my professional life as a software engineer at <HighlightLabel>Bsolus (sep 2014)</HighlightLabel>, an e-commerce company based in Braga. Here, I've been part of an amazing team building <HighlightLabel>Beevo</HighlightLabel>, an e-commerce solution tailored for medium-large sized companies. This experience has given me the oportunity to work on projects such as a <HighlightLabel>B2B online portal</HighlightLabel> for one of the largest beverage distributor in Portugal and in partnership with the Swedish team of Commerz, a company based in <HighlightLabel>Malm√∂, Sweden</HighlightLabel>.</p>
      <p>In the past months I have been working as a <HighlightLabel>remote software engineer</HighlightLabel>, and it has been a very rewarding experience. Working remotely allowed me to not only improve the way I manage my time, but also to work from wherever I feel more comfortable and productive. Following a daily routine tailored to your needs that is based purely on what you consider top priority every day is something that <HighlightLabel>boosts your health and productivity</HighlightLabel>. These last fews months have made me believe that a future where most of the workforce is remote not only is possible, but also is undoubtfully a <HighlightLabel>much healthier alternative</HighlightLabel>, and working remotely is something that I consider very important for my future endeavors.</p>
      <p>In my free time I enjoy reading, having a beer with my friends, and I love coding with my girlfriend <HighlightLabel>Mariana Capelo</HighlightLabel>. I also play in a pool team as a hobby.</p>
