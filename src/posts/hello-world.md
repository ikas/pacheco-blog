Hey :)

This post marks the beginning of my personal blog.

I've been working with some interesting topics lately, and I realized that I didn't have a good way of sharing my points of view and insights across the Web. Due to that, **one of my resolutions for the year of 2018 was to start blogging**. Posts will be mostly technical *(I know I know, I'm a geek)* and among other topics, I'll focus on:

* my professional or personal projects (for instance, how I created this blog).
* interesting technology that I have come across or decided to try.
* reviews of books that I have read.

I'll try to keep a weekly basis for my writing, while also improving the (currently awful) design of this blog. At the moment, the only way to follow up is via RSS feed ([there you go](/feed.xml)), but I'll be sharing my posts on Facebook, and there are plans for a newsletter in the long run.

I have recently renewed my developer environment at work, so on my next post I'll be talking a bit about my current development environment, the changes I made, and how you can set up a similar environment.

See you next time!
